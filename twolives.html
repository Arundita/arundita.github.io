              <p class="p-heading">Are you living two different lives?</p>
              <p class="separator">
              <b> Some people live two different lives. One that everyone sees, where they seem happy, satiated and doing well basically. This is where they are described as a friend, a colleague, a daughter, a student, a worker, and a young adult. These traits are not a mask or a layer that is a false representation of who they are, these are not lies; instead, they are a major part of who they are. They make them, describe them. For most people, this is it. This is all that they are, this is a complete definition; however, for some others, there is more. A struggle that stays hidden from what everyone else sees and the reason will shock and embarrass you. <br><br>

It is hard to understand. For someone who hasn’t experienced depression, could misinterpret it. Depression is often misconstrued. Most people would say depression is just being sad. Most people would tell you to “get over it” or “give it some time”. If you are sad because you had a breakup, or you didn't get the job you wanted, that's not depression. That’s sadness, sadness is a natural human emotion. Depression is not being sad when something in your life goes wrong. Depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right. <br><br>

Does this seem difficult to talk about? So much so that no one talks about it? We don’t hear about it or see it in the news or social media. People only publish or upload happy things, light, uplifting, motivating, and blah blah. There is no one updating their status and saying they had to struggle to get out of the bed today. Because you would comment “undisciplined” or “silly”. If someone tells you they have difficulty eating or sleeping you’d say “prepare a schedule”. We don't understand depression or the severity of it.<br><br>

We hear about suicides, we see people taking their lives and we wonder what could have gone wrong? We ask ourselves how could they do this? And we call them weak, a coward. When you see someone who committed suicide, you don't see a suicidal person, do you? You see someone who was happy, doing great in their professional and personal lives, was on the verge of success. So you say they weren’t suicidal, they weren't depressed, but you are wrong. <br><br>

People hide their everyday struggle, their pain, they put on a smile and appear to you as someone who's normal. These people live two different lives, where one person is always afraid of the other. They fear themselves. They fear their vulnerabilities. And this fear pushes them into a corner, where there is only one way out. And they think about it every day. Not just every day, but every single second, this thought never leaves them, always stays in the back of their head telling them to free themselves. Because that's the sickness, that's the struggle, that's depression and depression isn't chicken-pox. You don't beat it once and it's gone forever. It's something you live with. It's something you live in. You beat it every day and experience it every day. It does not and never leaves you. The scariest part is that, after a while, you become numb to it. It becomes normal to you. <br>
The funny thing is, it's not you who has the issue, instead, it's the stigma inside others, it's the shame and the embarrassment, the disapproving looks and dissociative behavior of the society. It is the whispers that you’re weak, that you’re crazy. That's what keeps you from getting help. The stigma is very real. It makes you hide it, it makes you feel empty, but you still hide it. Unfortunately, we live in a society and times, where disorders are the same as a lack of discipline. We are ignorant. We don't understand depression. We don't understand mental health. We push it aside, push it in a corner, pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself. The first step in solving any problem is recognizing that there is one. But we’re still afraid of the question. <br><br>

I wish I knew what the solution is, but I don't. I think the solution starts with us being honest and non-judgemental. Honest about our struggles and not judging others' struggles. Depression is not a wound that would heal with a band-aid. It's a disease that requires treatment, which begins with realizing the importance of healing. 
It's a disease and you are sick and that's okay. When we fracture our bones we get a plaster, similarly, when we break our mental health we need treatment. It doesn't mean that you're weak or incapable or undisciplined or a coward. It means you need help. It doesn't define you. It’s not an identity. It's not who you are. It's a disease that can be treated. It means you have strength. It means you are capable of overcoming adversities. It means you have a perspective. So don't be afraid of it. We need to learn to accept ourselves and love ourselves for who we are. Recognize and accept our vulnerabilities and talk about it.<br><br>

We can break the stigma, break the taboo, and be more kind to each other. And more importantly, realize that life is more important than social norms.<br><br><br><br>
