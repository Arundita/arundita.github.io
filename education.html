              <p class="p-heading">I have a Master of Science in Computer Engineering from New York University.</p>
              <p class="separator">My college experience at NYU has been my most valuable. I have countless reasons to admire my time at NYU; To list a few, firstly, it has given me a chance to gain hands-on skills in my field of choice. There have been, and there will continue to be, many opportunities to learn more ways of improving my craft as a result of my time at my school, which I am truly thankful for. For example, I have participated in various hackathons, worked on a variety of projects in fields such as machine learning, cloud computing, computer networking, cybersecurity, and web development. At NYU, I realize I still had a lot to learn despite what I thought; this allowed me to continue to improve my skills and gain more confidence in my area.
                <br><br> In addition to learning practical skills, being in a college in New York has also taught me a lot about different cultures and religious ideas. From this experience, I have learned many interesting things about other cultures. It has been valuable to me because it has cleared up some misconceptions I had, thus allowing me to be less ignorant of the topic. It has also given me a better understanding of othersâ€™ beliefs and traditions, no matter what region of the world they originated. This has made my time in college much more enriching and worthwhile <br><br> In summary, my time in college has enriched my life in many ways. It has provided me with the necessary tools to enhance my skills more, taught me valuable knowledge about this diverse world and people and concepts in general, and eventually will enable me to hopefully become more successful in life when I finally graduate and get my degree. It also has stressed to me the importance of thinking critically and asking questions in many situations. All these aspects of college have also made me more well-rounded as a person.</p>
